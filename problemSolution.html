            <h2>Current Problems:</h2>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>Issues that are present in the Megabiota laboratory research process can be focused around the two core
                topics:
            </p>
            <b>Distribution of Data</b>
            <br>
                    - Website is a small public platform
                <br>
                    - Website can only be accessed from web clients
                <br>
                    - Research papers typically read by only other researchers
                <br>
                    - Graphical data can only be obtained from programs like Panopoly
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Visualization of Data</b>
            <br>
                    - Tables of raw data are unappealing
                <br>
                    - Current graphics have no interaction with users
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Through a combination of these two problems, the data being produced by the Madingley model is not being
                properly introduced to the public as intended. Therefore these issues need to be remedied in order for
                the data from the revolutionary model to be fully utilized.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h2>Solution:</h2>

            <p> The general solution to this problem is to create an application that allows the target audience to
                visualize the results of the Madingley model. This describes the basic idea of how to solve the problem.
                In order to guide the end-user through the application, a handful of features must be identified: </p>
            <br>
            1) The user will be able to select a location based off of their own location or based off of a
            location selected on a map.
            <br>
            2) The user will be able to select a predefined Madingley Model scenario. The exact scenarios for this
            application have not been identified by the client. However, some examples include: bushmeat hunting,
            climate change, and deforestation.
            <br>
            3) The user will be able to choose a visualization style to display tailored results from the rendered
            scenario.
            <br>
            4) The user will be able to export the rendered data.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p> In order to allow the user to select some location, the application will need access to the userâ€™s GPS,
                or access to an interactive map object. In both situations the user will have selected some location of
                interest. This location selection will allow the application to hone in on the geographical area of
                interest.
            </p>
            <p>
                The user will then be asked to choose a scenario from a predefined list of scenarios, this list could
                include: climate change, deforestation, and bushmeat hunting. The scenario will allow the application to
                narrow down what dataset should be considered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given the selection of the above mentioned choices, the application will then be able to return a small
                finite set of data that will be of use to the end user. The final steps remaining in the solution plan
                involve the user selecting what type of output they wish to view. This option will then allow the
                application to tailor the scenario results to a pre-specified sub audience. This specification is done
                to allow the user to quickly and easily view the information of interest rather than a general
                output.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the user has viewed the rendered data, the final step that the user will be interested in, involves
                exporting the information. This step will allow the user to save the results of a scenario to be used
                later as they see fit, whether it be for further analysis or for presentation purposes.
            </p>
