            <p>Tropical forests are biodiversity hotspots filled with many species of flora, fauna, and fungi. Thousands
                of these species in recent years have become extinct. The root of this current mass extinction lies in a
                variety issues that have been unresolved for years. These include increased climate change from human
                sources, illegal deforestation/logging, and illegal poaching.</p>
            <p> Many scientists around the world have dedicated themselves to specifically researching and collecting
                information on this topic. From this, many solutions and models have been created in attempt to remedy
                the predicament that vulnerable biodiverse areas like tropical forests are in. One of the leading models
                currently is the Madingley Model. It possesses revolutionary capabilities that allow it to surpass other
                existing models, such as being able to represent all life on Earth. Another distinguishing feature is
                its ability to include the interactions between different species and the environment. It can also be
                specified for each ecosystem. Having this unique feature allows for changes over time in the
                interactions between species, since it is not a fixed concept as defined in other similar models.
            </p>
            <p>Even though it has a lot of important information on these topics, the Madingley model is a very complex
                framework that requires some level of expertise from both the software side, and ecology/biology to
                understand and operate. Therefore, we developed an application that provides an easy-to-use experience
                for users who do not have the: money, technical expertise, or computer hardware to run this model.
                By creating this app, we hope to raise awareness for the importance of biodiversity by presenting
                findings from the Madingley model to all users that have an internet capable browser or
                device.</p>

            <p>As you can see in the Fall 2020 Gantt Chart, we spent about five months planning and
                researching. In particular, one of the main things we accomplished in the first half of our project was
                outlining our Minimum Viable Product (MVP). In addition to that task, we also created a rough model of
                the application, developed a better understanding of the Madingley Model, and researched possible
                software that we could use for our solution.</p>
            <p>After we solidified the requirements, we were able to move onto the implementation part of our project.
                During the Spring 2021 semester, we wrote all the code needed to satisfy the requirements. Throughout
                the implementation process, the team simultaneously worked on the frontend and the backend components.
                In terms of the frontend, some of the things we were able to accomplish were having a working map
                selection component, successfully translating our app to several languages besides English, and creating
                a results page that contained visuals that were easy for the user to understand. In addition to that, we
                also able to get the AWS Lambda, AWS S3 Bucket, and API Gateway working on the backend. We ended up
                completing the project in April 2021 and we delivered the finished product to the client. He was very
                pleased with the results and he is planning on adding to it in the future.
