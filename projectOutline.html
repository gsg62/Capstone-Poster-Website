            <h2>Project Outline Page</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Our team has accomplished a lot since we originally started this project. As seen in the Fall 2020 Gantt
                Chart, one of the main things we have accomplished so far is refining our MVP. In addition to that task,
                we also created a rough model of the application, developed a better understanding of the Madingley
                Model, and researched possible services that we could use for our solution.
            </p>
            <p> As the first part of our project comes to a close, we are optimistically looking toward the second half
                of our project. This stage will start during our winter break. Over winter break, we are planning on
                gaining more experience with Ionic and AWS. At the conclusion of break, we will be ready to complete the
                next steps of our project. The first step our team is looking forward to is the development of the front
                end interface. The main requirement that we will be adding first will be the implementation of a basic
                Graphic User Interface. By doing this, we will have a working application for Android, iOS, and the
                web.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, we will implement the code needed for data processing and location access. This will require the
                use of databases, as seen in the Spring 2021 Gantt chart. Our team will also implement the Madingley
                Model simulations, so that the user has a better way to visualize the data. We wonâ€™t have to create the
                simulations. Instead, we will create a better way to visualize the data from the simulations. In this
                version, we will also implement the ability for the user to select an area on which they want to run the
                simulations. This was one of the main requirements emphasized by the client, so it will be vital for us
                to implement this at this part of the development process. Next, we will add the back end of the
                program. The back end will give us the ability to process information from both the user and the stored
                data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, we will create a full prototype that will have all the features we decided on for the MVP. If
                time permits, we will also try to include a couple of the stretch goals into this prototype. The first
                stretch goal that we plan on implementing is a multiple language feature. The user would be able to use
                our product from a small group of languages. If we get that implemented, the next feature we hope to add
                is providing the user with the ability to export the output. This would allow the user to save
                information and eliminate the need for them to rerun the program every time they want to visualize the
                same data. However, before we can implement those features, we will have to make sure that all the
                features of the MVP work almost perfectly. There might be a few areas of the code that need to be
                perfected, but 90% of the project will be completed once we have finished the full prototype. Lastly, we
                will fine tune and put the finishing adjustments on our prototype, so that we can deliver the final
                product to our client.
